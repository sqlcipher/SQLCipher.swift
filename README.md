# SQLCipher.swift

SQLCipher.swift is based on [SQLCipher Core](https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher) and is the official Swift Package for SQLCipher maintained by [Zetetic, LLC](https://www.zetetic.net).

SQLCipher is a standalone fork of the [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database library that adds 256 bit AES encryption of database files and other security features like:

- on-the-fly encryption
- tamper detection
- memory sanitization
- strong key derivation

## Installation

**Xcode**

1. In Xcode go to File > Add Packages...
2. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher-spm`
3. Choose your desired version or branch.

**Package Dependency**

1. Add the following to your `Package.swift` file:

```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/sqlcipher/SQLCipher.swift.git", from: "4.10.0")
]
```
2. Build your project:

```
$ swift build
```

### Import SQLCipher

For Swift based projects, import the SQLCipher module using `import SQLCipher`

For Objective-C based projets, import the SQLCipher module using `#import <SQLCipher/SQLCipher.h>`

### Builds Settings

To enable SQLCipher encryption in your consuming project, you must set the `SQLITE_HAS_CODEC` Build Setting flag.

For Swift based projects, go to your project's Build Settings and search for Preprocessor Macros, enter `SQLITE_HAS_CODEC=1` for both Debug and Release Preprocessor Macros.

For Objective-C based projects, go to your project's Build Settings and search for Other C Flags, enter `-DSQITE_HAS_CODEC` for both Debug and Release Other C Flags.
